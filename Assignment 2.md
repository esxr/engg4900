**Q1**
“After graduating with an engineering degree from UQ, you will be eligible to practice as a professional engineer in Queensland”.

The process of becoming a professional engineer involves meeting specific eligibility requirements and demonstrating competence in the relevant areas of engineering. 

In Queensland, practicing engineers must be registered to carry out professional engineering services.<sup>[4]</sup> Registration as a RPEQ is _formal recognition of the qualification and competency of an engineer in the State of Queensland_.<sup>[3]</sup> It is a four stage process:

The education that I have received at UQ has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the principles of software engineering. My program includes a lot of practical experience, with significant exposure to the industry, which allows me to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world engineering projects. My degree is a **recognised four-year professional engineering degree**<sup>[1]</sup>, which qualifies me as a Professional Engineer in Australia.

Also, the program requires me to complete at least **450 hours of Engineering Professional Practice**<sup>[2]</sup> before graduation. This makes sure that, going forward, I'm prepared to hit the ground running with significant prior experience. Together, my degree and the Engineering Professional Practice hours cover a significant part of the first two stages of the process.

I understand that becoming a registered professional engineer will require ongoing professional development and a commitment to adhering to the standards of competence and ethics set out by the Board of Professional Engineers of Queensland. Engineers Australia also states that if you work under the direct supervision of a registered engineer, you can carry out professional engineering services. That is why, until I get the RPEQ certification, I will work under a registered software engineer.

Software engineering is a field of opportunities, and I have had numerous experience before. I am committed to continuously learning and staying up to date with the latest developments in the field of engineering. Moreover, recent graduates have a huge advantage over industry professionals in that the knowledge they gain is fresh, especially because UQ keeps the courses updated to reflect the latest trends in software engineering. This makes me confident that I will be able to join a software company and practice professional after graduating from UQ. I am eager to explore the opportunities that lie ahead and to continue learning and growing as an engineer. I am committed to upholding the highest standards of competence and ethics and making a positive impact in the field of engineering.

**Q2.**
**a)** Included in the end
**b)** I have completed 537 hours in the industry as part of my Engineering Professional Practice, in which I have learnt about numerous processes and systems in place that make a technological venture successful. I have been lucky to have worked closely under highly experienced professionals and academics alike. Apart from that, I have also started and run 2 software startups. Running my own startup gave me the experience and courage required to learn things and explore all on my own. I has also given me a very good sense of prioritizing my tasks and using every resource available to me to get tasks done. It has also given me experience in a wide range of activities - from talking to clients, drafting legal papers and consulting professionals to doing detailed financial analyses of my projects.

**c)** 
**Competency 1:** Judgement:
Judgement is developed as a result of facing real life challenges and responding to them aptly. That is why I firmly believe that this competency can only be increased by putting in effort and time in the industry. I plan to take up as many opportunities in the industry as I can to increase my chances of facing and solving critical problems and improve my judgement.

**Competency 2:** Evaluation:
This competency is also similar to judgement in that it is a result of time rather than talent. Leadership roles within the team which require me to see the bigger picture of the project, where it fits in, and how it affects its stakeholders are the best way for me to cultivate this skill. I also plan to work directly under leaders so as to learn how they solve the problems and apply the same later on.
